# Seagull Theory

## Introduction

Seagull Theory is a stenography theory. It is a set of principles, briefs, and rules for how to type on a stenography keyboard. It was created by Michael Maloney in response to the deficiencies of the standard dictionary in Plover, a desire for an intelligible standard, frustrations with existing standards, and general ignorance on his part of the practice of stenography.

## Keyboard layout

Seagull only assumes a standard stenography keyboard with letters.

The long \* key is considered reserved for backspacing. But no other combinations are. In particular, this means any extension (including use for fingerspelling, numbers, etc) should be cautious about making use of this.

The author of Seagull uses a Uni stenography keyboard with additional control keys ^ and +. It is recommended that extensions lean towards gating with these.

## Scope

The base of Seagull Theory is a dictionary of common English words and principles by which to spell them on a traditional stenography keyboard.

There are a few notable things which fall outside the scope of Seagull:

- Control characters. Eg, how to move around a document, affect capitalization, or insert newlines.
- Punctuation. Eg, how to insert commas, periods, quotes.
- Proper nouns. There are so many proper nouns they deserve separate treatment. Moreover, they introduce homophones and beg for a control charater to insert them.
- Numbers. Numbers suck.
- Fingerspelling.

# Dictionary

Seagull is primarily a dictionary of common English words and a canonical spelling on a stenography keyboard. This means that each entry is itself a word, giving a canonical outline. And in reverse, each outline gives a word.

There are no multiple-word briefs or phaseology in Seagull. "Words" which contain a space must be spelled out by their parts.

The basis for the outlines should be founded in existing theory in most cases. In practice, this means that the outline should be found either in Mirabai Knight's dictionary (main.json in Plover) or else in Aerickt's Lapwing dictionary. If it comes from neither of these, an explanation is required for why the outline departs from either.

## Basis

The author values the tradition in any discipline, even when he is tempted to part with it. For this reason, the core vocabulary

## Mechanics

Some mechanics that Seagull seeks to clarify over traditional stenography theories:

- Word completion.
- Henkan.
- The prefix trie.
- Formal prefixes and suffixes.
