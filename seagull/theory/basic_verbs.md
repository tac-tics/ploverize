# Basic Verbs

Some of the basic verbs are so common that they suggest the use of briefs.

Moreover, they sometimes lead to conflicts, both when spelled phonetically and when spelled orthographically. So we take care to give them these briefs.


## to be

The verb to be boths acts as the copula of the English language and is used in the continuous form. The briefs are spelled using the left-side "B" (PW) when the form begins with a 'b'. The equally common forms "are" and "is" are single-letter briefs. The past and subjective "was" and "were" are spelled without vowels. The form "am" is spelled naturally.
